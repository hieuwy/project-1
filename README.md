# Name TBP Project 1
## User Story
```
- As developers
- We want to create a platform that will allow users to find locations to eat based on a set list of filters provided for the user to narrow searches.
- So that users can create a list of restaurants to visit based on the location they choose.
- We also want to allow users to view and rate restaurants based on their queries and experiences
- So that users can vote on their satisfaction on their experiences and view whether a restaurant is good or not
